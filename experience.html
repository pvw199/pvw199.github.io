          					Whilst in secondary education, I attended the Haspengouw Academy of Arts ('Academie Haspengouw' in Dutch) after school for three years.

          					<br>
          					I participated in the project for two consecutive years. It was designed to help primary school pupils with their studies. Although open to all pupils with learning difficulties, the programme focused on those who didn't get the help they needed from their parents due to various social reasons. Besides being a tutor and mentor to the pupils, it was important to become a friend, or 'buddy', as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed contributing to this great initiative.
